About Layers
============

Custom layers that we have implemented belong here. These include things like
knowledge encoders (which encode the memory component of a memory network),
knowledge selectors (which perform an attention over the memory), and entailment
models. There's also an encoders submodule, containing sentence encoders that
convert an embedded word (or character) sequence into a vector.
