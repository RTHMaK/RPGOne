Memory Networks
===============

This module contains our implementation of Memory Networks. The base
implementation is designed to be modular, so you can use the same basic
architecture to implement a large family of models. To get the original memory
network (and all variants that perform the bAbI tasks), use the
SoftmaxMemoryNetwork model.

Top Level Design
----------------

The below diagram gives a top level abstraction of what comprises a memory
network. It follows several basic steps:

.. image:: ../img/module_breakdown.png

* Encode the Question and Background Knowledge using a sentence encoder. This
  might be an LSTM, BOW, or something more complex, such as a TreeLSTM.
* Given the encoded Question, Background Knowledge and an initialised Memory,
  proceed to do several "Memory hops". This process includes:

  * Attend over the Background Knowledge. This could be a simple dot product
    similarity with the Memory vector, or a more complicated parameterized
    attention function.
  * Combine the generated attention with the background knowledge. As standard,
    this would be a weighted average, but other, more complex ways of combining
    these are possible.
  * Using the attended knowledge, question and memory, update the memory vector
    for input to the next memory network hop.
* After X number of memory network hops, create a vector for
  classification/entailment. This could be just the final memory step, or
  something more, such as the original question.
* Now, depending on the type of Solver, we use different types of final layer to
  get the required output. For instance, a MultipleChoiceMemoryNetworkSolver
  will use a softmax to generate a distribution over the possible answer
  candidates.

Hopefully the above gives a clear way to approach this library.
