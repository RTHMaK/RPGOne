    """
    A ``WordAndCharacterTokenizer`` first splits strings into words, then splits those words into
    characters, and returns a representation that contains `both` a word index and a sequence of
    character indices for each word.  See the documention for ``WordTokenizer`` for a note about
    naming, and the typical notion of "tokenization" in NLP.

    Notes
    -----
    In ``embed_input``, this ``Tokenizer`` uses an encoder to get a character-level word embedding,
    which then gets concatenated with a standard word embedding from an embedding matrix.  To
    specify the encoder to use for this character-level word embedding, use the ``"word"`` key in
    the ``encoder`` parameter to your model (which should be a ``TextTrainer`` subclass - see the
    documentation there for some more info).  If you do not give a ``"word"`` key in the
    ``encoder`` dict, we'll create a new encoder using the ``"default"`` parameters.

        A combined word-and-characters representation requires some fancy footwork to do the
        embedding properly.

        This method assumes the input shape is (..., sentence_length, word_length + 1), where the
        first integer for each word in the tensor is the word index, and the remaining word_length
        entries is the character sequence.  We'll first split this into two tensors, one of shape
        (..., sentence_length), and one of shape (..., sentence_length, word_length), where the
        first is the word sequence, and the second is the character sequence for each word.  We'll
        pass the word sequence through an embedding layer, as normal, and pass the character
        sequence through a _separate_ embedding layer, then an encoder, to get a word vector out.
