Multiple Choice QA models try to answer multiple choice questions.  Typically, these questions
have a sequence of text specifying the question, and one sequence of text per answer option,
though each question can also optionally have some background text associated with it.

*Inputs:* A question, a sequence of answer options, and (optionally) background text in some form

*Outputs:* A probability distribution over the answer options indicating how likely each option is
to be correct
