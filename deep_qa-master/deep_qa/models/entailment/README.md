Entailment models take two sequences of text as input and make a classification decision on the
pair.  Typically that decision represents whether one sentence entails the other, but we'll use
this family of models to represent any kind of classification decision over pairs of text.

*Inputs:* Two text sequences

*Output:* Some classification decision (typically "entails/not entails",
"entails/neutral/contradicts", or similar)
