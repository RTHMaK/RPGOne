class BidirectionalAttentionFlow(TextTrainer):
    """
    This class implements Minjoon Seo's `Bidirectional Attention Flow model
    <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bidirectional-Attention-Flow-for-Machine-Seo-Kembhavi/7586b7cca1deba124af80609327395e613a20e9d>`_
    for answering reading comprehension questions (ICLR 2017).

    The basic layout is pretty simple: encode words as a combination of word embeddings and a
    character-level encoder, pass the word representations through a bi-LSTM/GRU, use a matrix of
    attentions to put question information into the passage word representations (this is the only
    part that is at all non-standard), pass this through another few layers of bi-LSTMs/GRUs, and
    do a softmax over span start and span end.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_hidden_seq2seq_layers : int, optional (default: ``2``)
        At the end of the model, we add a few stacked biLSTMs (or similar), to give the model some
        depth.  This parameter controls how many deep layers we should use.
    num_passage_words : int, optional (default: ``None``)
        If set, we will truncate (or pad) all passages to this length.  If not set, we will pad all
        passages to be the same length as the longest passage in the data.
    num_question_words : int, optional (default: ``None``)
        Same as ``num_passage_words``, but for the number of words in the question.  (default:
        ``None``)
    num_highway_layers : int, optional (default: ``2``)
        After constructing a word embedding, but before the first biLSTM layer, Min has some
        ``Highway`` layers operating on the word embedding layer.  This parameter specifies how
        many of those to do.  (default: ``2``)
    highway_activation : string, optional (default: ``'relu'``)
        Specifies the activation function to use for the ``Highway`` layers mentioned above.  Any
        Keras activation function is acceptable here.
    similarity_function : Dict[str, Any], optional (default: ``{'type': 'linear', 'combination': 'x,y,x*y'}``)
        Specifies the similarity function to use when computing a similarity matrix between
        question words and passage words.  By default we use the function Min used in his paper.

    Notes
    -----
    Min's code uses tensors of shape ``(batch_size, num_sentences, sentence_length)`` to represent
    the passage, splitting it up into sentences, where here we just have one long passage sequence.
    I was originally afraid this might mean he applied the biLSTM on each sentence independently,
    but it looks like he flattens it to our shape before he does any actual operations on it.  So,
    I `think` this is implementing pretty much exactly what he did, but I'm not totally certain.
