This is a place for untested layers that aren't in current use in our models.  We have a few
layers implemented that never saw serious use, and we don't want to spend too much effort
maintaining them.  If someone wants to write tests for these to make sure they work, or use them in
a model, we can move them back into the main `deep_qa` code.
