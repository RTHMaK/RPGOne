# Aston Beamforming Workshop

In the [workshop](https://osf.io/tga2w/) we discussed how to improve beamforming methods for clinical applications and research for Elekta users. In this repository we are sharing analysis code that relates to this.

Right now there is not much organization yet. We could organize it as
```
./fieldtrip
./mne
./spm
./nutmegtrip
```
or organize it like this
```
./robert
./alex
./vladimir
./sarang
```

Please let us know what you prefer and/or simply do it the way you like.
